Change cases
============
With the progress of information technology and genetics, we need to consider some potential problems. 
These problems can be divided into two aspects. We can discuss them from the following aspects: 
1. The development of information technology is rapid and tremendous, but no matter what. How it changes, the basic technology is fixed,
we need to focus on the growing gene database. Therefore, it is very important for us to optimize gene expression data and shorten the response time of browsers. 
2. In the field of genetics, the future progress of genetics is multidirectional, but we can be sure that our understanding of genes is only a drop in the ocean. 
Therefore, in the future, genes may be a huge information base, so we must maintain and organize the existing gene database. This is important for future development.
